# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic based on medical diagnostic measurements from the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

The project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Training multiple ML models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and accuracy comparison
- Saving the final model and scaler using pickle

## Dataset
Source: PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset  
File: `diabetes.csv`

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression (final chosen model)
- Random Forest Classifier

**Logistic Regression** performed the best on the test dataset with stable accuracy, so it was selected as the final model.
